Welcome to my home on the web.  Here you can find occasional notes about various tech subjects if I think others
might find my insights useful (or if I really just need to write it down somewhere so I don't forget).

The site uses [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), a blogging framework for developers.  Behind the scenes, its using some handy tools,
like [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/).  The site is hosted on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/).

 * The folks at Github for creating [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), on which Octopress is based
