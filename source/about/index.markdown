Hi, I'm David, and this is my home on the web.

A native of London, Ontario, I now live in Toronto with my wife, Jo, and our dog, Felix.  I work as a Software Engineer
for [Spindance](http://www.spindance.com), a company I started working for during my eight years in Michigan.
I graduated from Calvin College in 2008 with majors in Electrical & Computer Engineering and French.

Most of the software I write these days is in Ruby, with Rails making frequent appearences.  However, variety and constant learning are
what keep me going, so I look forward to times when I use Java, C, C++, and whatever else gets thrown at me (I'm looking at you, Lisp).
I love using open-source software to develop elegant solutions to difficult problems.  Usually, you'll find me running some flavour of 
Linux ([Mint](http://linuxmint.com/) or [CentOS](http://centos.org/), mostly). Coming from an engineering background,
 I'm always happy to get my hands on some hardware.

Apart from software, I enjoy music, travel, food, languages (especially French), reading, playing guitar, grammar, and
current events.  I'm a big board game nerd, [Carcasonne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_\(board_game\)) and 
[Settlers of Catan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlers_of_Catan) being some of my favourites. 
My favourite books are [The Brothers K](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_K) and [The Time Traveler's Wife](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Traveller%27s_Wife).
I've been known to quote [Firefly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_\(TV_series\)) on a regular basis.
