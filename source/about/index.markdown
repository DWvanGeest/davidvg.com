Hi, I'm David, and this is my home on the web.

A native of London, Ontario, I now live in Toronto with my dog, Felix.  I work as a Lead Software Engineer
for [SpinDance](http://www.spindance.com), a company I started working for during my eight years in Michigan.
I graduated from Calvin College in 2008 with majors in Electrical & Computer Engineering and French.

Most of the software I write these days is in Scala, Java, or Ruby. I do plenty of Rails work, but writing some nice code for Akka is where I'm happiest.  That said, constant learning is
what keeps me going, so I look forward to times when I use C, Lisp, or Erlang (or whatever else gets thrown at me!).
I love using open-source software to develop elegant solutions to difficult problems.  Usually, you'll find me running some flavour of
Linux ([Mint](http://linuxmint.com/) or [CentOS](http://centos.org/), mostly). Coming from an engineering background,
 I'm always happy to get my hands on some hardware.

My areas of professional interest include scalable and distributed systems, polyglot programming, test-driven development, open-source software, security, and API design. I am passionate about increasing the quality of all software, and try my best to share that passion with my collaborators.

Apart from software, I enjoy music, travel, food, languages (especially French), reading, playing guitar, grammar, and
current events.  I'm a big board game nerd, [Pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic_\(board_game\)) and
[Dominion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_\(card_game\)) being some of my favourites.
My favourite books are [The Brothers K](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_K) and [The Time Traveler's Wife](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Traveller%27s_Wife).
I've been known to quote [Firefly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_\(TV_series\)) on a regular basis.
