	Visitors to this site (all eleven of them) will be pleased to note that I&#39;ve found gainful employment. I&#39;m on <del>three-month</del> six-month contract as a Software Engineer at <a href="http://spindance.com">SpinDance</a> in Holland, MI. Things are going well, and I&#39;m quite pleased. Consider me off the job market for now!</p>
