	Just like to give a shout-out to a former project of mine that&#39;s available for public demo: <a href="http://whaledrop.com">whaledrop.com</a>. Whaledrop is a hosted Digital Asset Management system for individuals and small businesses, and it&#39;s pretty dang cool. Check it out!</p>
<p>
	EDIT: The team at Whaledrop has opened up the Whaledrop Asset Courier for public beta. You can use the Whaledrop Asset Courier to send very large files and private information securely by email. You can also track the status of your email delivery on the Whaledrop web page. I use it, you should too :-).</p>
