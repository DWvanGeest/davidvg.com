	<a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> has been around for a while, but I hadn&#39;t really been interested in it until my fiancee&#39;s laptop started making strange noises. As a result she&#39;s using my desktop to do some of her work, as well as her (possibly dying) laptop. Not to mention she&#39;s constantly emailing herself files to access them on school computers. So, a backup and sync solution seems to be in order.</p>
<p>
	Having set Dropbox up for both of us, I&#39;m really impressed so far, especially since it works seamlessly with Linux, my platform of choice. Ars Technica has a good <a href="http://arstechnica.com/software/news/2008/09/how-dropbox-ended-my-search-for-seamless-sync-on-linux.ars">review</a> of the service, and many others have jotted down their thoughts, so I&#39;m not going to go any further than saying I like it.</p>
<p>
	If you&#39;re interested in using Dropbox, use this referral link: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTMyMDkwNDc5">https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTMyMDkwNDc5</a>, and we&#39;ll both get an extra 250 MB of storage!</p>
