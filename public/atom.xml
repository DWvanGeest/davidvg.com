    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know, usually people go the other way.  This is a bit of special case though:  a contractor had a project in git which we needed to import on our SVN server.  The contractor was only able to provide a zip of his repo, for various reasons.  This seems to preclude the widely used method detailed <a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/ImportingFromGit">here</a>.  I&#8217;m not enough of a git wizard to modify that for our specific situation.</p>




<p>Ironically enough, Mercurial provided the easiest solution.</p>




<p>Install Mercurial and a python subversion lib if you haven&#8217;t already (I&#8217;m using Ubuntu, adjust as necessary):<br/><br/>
<code>sudo apt-get install mercurial python-subversion</code></p>




<p>Configure Mercurial to use the ConvertExtension.  Add this to ~/.hgrc:<br/><br/>
<code>[extensions]<br/>
hgext.convert=
</code></p>




<p>Use Mercurial to covert from git to svn:<br/><br/>
<code>hg convert --dest-type svn path/to/git/repo path/to/new/svn/repo</code></p>




<p>Now you should have a directory with a full SVN repo, complete with commit history.  Note that the commit times will not be correct.</p>




<p>If needed, you can move your new SVN repo to another server using the excellent instructions <a href="http://www.petefreitag.com/item/665.cfm">here</a>.</p>

    <id>http://davidvg.com/2011/10/28/hacking-session-maintenance-with-authlogic-and-factory-girl</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic">Authlogic</a> to provide authentication for a couple Rails projects.  I also use <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl">Factory Girl</a> as a fixtures replacement.</p>

<p>When FG creates a User for you, a new UserSession automatically gets created.  This is by virtue of Authlogic&#8217;s automatic session maintenance, which can be pretty handy.  However, in my tests I want complete control over the UserSession.  Just because I created a new user, doesn&#8217;t mean I want that user logged in.  In many cases, I <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> want the user to be logged in, and this behavior was causing my tests to fail.</p>

<p>To work around this behaviour, I ended up adding this to my User factory:<br/><br/>
<code>
    after_create do |u|<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;u.class.maintain_sessions = false<br/>
    end
</code></p>

<p>That quashed the autogenerated UserSession.  There might be a cleaner method somewhere, but so far this is doing the trick for me.</p>

    <id>http://davidvg.com/2011/10/18/excluding-all-attributes-in-options-for-to_json</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ran across a strange gotcha while working in Rails 3.0 today, having to do with the <code>:only</code> option to the <code>to_json</code> method.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a Widget on which you call <code>to_json</code>.  You don&#8217;t want <strong>any</strong> of the widget&#8217;s attributes to appear in the JSON (maybe you only want some method results).  Normally, one would expect<br/><br/><code>{:only => [], :methods => [:foo, :bar]}</code><br/><br/>to do the trick.</p>

<p>Strangely, this didn&#8217;t work.  I found I needed to put a nil in the empty <code>:only</code> array, like so: <br/><br/><code>{:only => [nil], :methods => [:foo, :bar]}</code><br/><br/>for everything to work as expected.</p>

<p>This might have something to do with the fact that I&#8217;m using the json gem, but I haven&#8217;t had the time to dive into that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m constantly forgetting how to enable profiling and turn off query caching in MySQL.  So for my own benefit, and possibly yours, here&#8217;s the goods.</p>

<p>Turn off the query cache for your particular connection:<br/>
<code>SET SESSION query_cache_type = OFF;</code></p>

<p>Enable profiling for your connection:<br/>
<code>SET profiling=1;</code></p>

<p>Run the query:<br/>
<code>SELECT * FROM widgets WHERE plant_id = 5 ORDER BY widget_id DESC LIMIT 1;</code></p>

<p>Show the profile:<br/>
<code>SHOW profile;</code></p>

<p>You&#8217;ll get something like this:<br/>
<code>

<p>Remember that the time in the right column actually corresponds to to the operation in the row ABOVE.  So in this case, the operation that took 0.001665 seconds was the &#8220;Sorting result&#8221; operation, not the &#8220;Sending data&#8221; operation.</p>

    <id>http://davidvg.com/2011/04/04/using-a-virtualbox-host-only-interface-when-bridged-interface-is-unavailable</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On my current project, I use an Ubuntu Server virtual machine to run MySQL and Rails.  It makes it easy to keep my development environments for conflicting projects separate&#8230; my previous project used a different version of both MySQL and Rails.  For Ruby and Rails, this problem can be solved with <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">RVM</a>, but that&#8217;s another story.</p>

<p>My Ubuntu VM has two network adapters, one bridged to eth0 on my host, and the second a host-only interface.  The idea here is that I still have network access to the VM when my wired connection on the host is down.  Imagine my suprise, however, when DHCP was failing on the host-only interface while the bridged network was down.  In theory, the host-only networking should work fine even if the host&#8217;s bridged interface is physically disconnected (I&#8217;m using wireless instead of my normal wired connection, so there&#8217;s nothing connected to my host&#8217;s Ethernet port).</p>

<p>After mucking about for a bit, I discovered the secret to host-only harmony.  I had to turn off the VM, then in VirtualBox go to Settings -> Network, select the tab for my bridged adapter, click Advanced, and un-check the &#8220;Cable Connected&#8221; box.  When I booted the VM again, the host-only adapter was able to DHCP an address on the host-only network, and I could be productive again :-).</p>

    <link href="http://davidvg.com/2011/03/20/installing-the-starcraft-2-demo-on-linux-mint/"/>
    <updated>2011-03-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidvg.com/2011/03/20/installing-the-starcraft-2-demo-on-linux-mint</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
	I&#8217;m an infrequent gamer, but occasionally I get bored enough to fire something up, generally an RTS of some variety. Today was a rainy Sunday, so I figured I would give StarCraft II a try. I don&#8217;t own the game, and didn&#8217;t intend to buy it without trying it out on Linux, so I installed the demo using <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>.</p>
<p>
	There&#8217;s a few walk-throughs on the web that I followed to get this going, but none of them specifically addressed the demo. If you&#8217;re trying to install the full version of the game, I suspect that <a href="http://www.playonlinux.com/">PlayOnLinux</a> would be easier (see the referenced walkthroughs for instructions).  But since PlayOnLinux doesn&#8217;t support the demo, here&#8217;s what I did.  These instructions are for Linux Mint, but they should work fine on Ubuntu without modification, or other distros with a few small changes.</p>
<ul>
	
<li><p>To get the audio working correctly, I had to install wine1.3, compiled with PulseAudio support (instead of wine1.2 which is in the Mint 9 repositories).  I found a PPA for that here: <a href="https://launchpad.net/~c-korn/+archive/ppa">https://launchpad.net/~c-korn/+archive/ppa</a>.  If you want, you can just download and install the .deb instead of adding the whole PPA.</p></li>

<li><p>Get the latest winetricks script:</p>

<typo:code lang="bash">
wget http://winezeug.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/winetricks
</typo:code><br/>
</li>
<li><p>Make it executable, and install some extras not included with Wine.  I&#8217;m not sure if all of these are needed, but these installed without error for me:</p>
<typo:code lang="bash">
chmod +x winetricks
./winetricks droid fontfix fontsmooth-rgb vcrun2005 allfonts d3dx9 win7
</typo:code><br/>
</li>

<li><p>Some walk-throughs suggest installing gecko for wine, I did that the following way:</p>
<typo:code lang="bash">
wget  http://winezeug.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/install-gecko.sh
chmod +x install-gecko.sh 
sudo ./install-gecko.sh
</typo:code><br/>
</li>

<li><p>Configure Wine to use PulseAudio, if necessary:</p>
<typo:code lang="bash">
winecfg
</typo:code><br/>

<p>Then go to the &#8216;Audio&#8217; tab and select the PulseAudio Driver in the Sound Drivers tree</p></li>

<li><p>Configure Wine to disable mmdevapi.  In the Libraries tab, under Existing Overrides, you may have mmdevapi listed.  Select it, click Edit, and choose Disabled.  If it&#8217;s not in the list, some people recommend adding it by finding mmdevapi in the above drop-down and clicking Add, then disabling it as before.</p></li>
<li>
		<p>Download the demo downloader from here:Â <a href="https://us.battle.net/account/sc2-demo.html">https://us.battle.net/account/sc2-demo.html</a></p></li>
	
<li>
<p>Run the demo downloader using wine:</p>

<typo:code lang="bash">
chmod +x SC2-WingsOfLibertyDemo-enUS-downloader.exe 
wine SC2-WingsOfLibertyDemo-enUS-downloader.exe
</typo:code><br/>


<p>The download is pretty big.  Go play outside :-).</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the downloader is complete, it will give you the option to install the demo.  Go ahead and do that.</p></li>
<li><p>The demo installer adds a Desktop icon, and an icon in your Wine menu.  At this point, you are hopefully good to go.  Performance under Wine is not as good as on Windows, so you may have to tweak your graphics settings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The demo was enjoyable, if a little tame.  I might consider buying the game in the unlikely event that I suddenly find myself with a lot of free time :-).  For reference, I used the following two sites to put these steps together:</p>
<ul>
<li>

	As a result of switching to Typo for davidvg.com, I will no longer be maintaining 60cycleCMS.

<p>
	Frankly, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend using it for new websites.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
	So, regular readers of this site (all two of them) may have noticed that 60cycle.net wasn&#39;t getting a whole lot of love lately. &nbsp;There&#39;s a couple reasons for that. &nbsp;Number one, Jo and I tied the knot back in June (huzzah!), and number two, I was busy working on davidvg.com.</p>
<p>
	Why a new site, you ask? &nbsp;Good question. &nbsp;I wrote 60cycle.net and 60cycleCMS back when I didn&#39;t know a whole lot about web development. &nbsp;It was cool to learn some PHP and MySQL, but it didn&#39;t teach me a lot about actual web development strategies (MVC patterns, for example). &nbsp;When my work compelled me to write a website, I jumped on the chance to learn Ruby on Rails, and I never looked back.</p>
<p>
	Having learned the Rails way of doing things, I felt pretty silly about 60cycleCMS. &nbsp;I toyed around with writing a new CMS in Rails, but, let&#39;s face it, why re-invent the wheel? &nbsp;Typo would do most of what I wanted. &nbsp;So, I installed Typo and started hacking. &nbsp;A few things annoyed me about Typo, and the iamrice theme, while being pretty darn awesome, wasn&#39;t exactly what I wanted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	davidvg.com is the result of my mods to Typo and iamrice. &nbsp;Now that I&#39;ve got the site running the way I like, hopefully the blog will see a little more action :-). &nbsp;Let me know if you find anything amiss!</p>

    <link href="http://davidvg.com/2010/04/06/missing-foreign-key-constraints-in-rails-test-database/"/>
    <updated>2010-04-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidvg.com/2010/04/06/missing-foreign-key-constraints-in-rails-test-database</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
	Wondering why your foreign key constraints are never created in your Rails test database? Chances are you, like me, are creating your referential integrity constraints using execute calls in a migration. These database-implementation-specific statements cannot be included in the DB-independent schema.rb file, so when you run<code> rake test:db:prepare</code> (or it is called implicitly by <code>rake test:functionals</code>), your FK constraints are not included in the test database.</p>
<p>
	The workaround to this is simple. In your environment.rb file, add (or uncomment) a line as follows:</p>
<p>
	<code>config.active_record.schema_format = :sql</code></p>
<p>
	Now Rails will load the test DB structure from db/development_structure.rb, which should be automatically created when you run your tests. You can also create it manually using <code>rake db:structure:dump</code>.</p>

    <link href="http://davidvg.com/2010/03/27/supposed-security-vulnerabilities-in-60cyclecms/"/>
    <updated>2010-03-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidvg.com/2010/03/27/supposed-security-vulnerabilities-in-60cyclecms</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
	Googling 60cycleCMS these days brings up a few &quot;security vulnerabilities&quot; that, at first glance, are somewhat alarming. The first alleged vulnerability is generally described as an HTML injection or a persistent XSS (cross-site scripting) vulnerability. Here&#39;s a <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/38637/info">link</a> to a report (the reports tend to multiply across the web, so there are other sites describing the same exploit).</p>
<p>
	I&#39;m all for transparency and openness in coding, and I&#39;m glad people take time to expose vulnerabilities in others&#39; code. However, this XSS &quot;vulnerability&quot; really needs to be put in context.</p>
<p>
	The XSS exploit states that an attacker can insert malicious HTML or Javascript into an existing post using the &quot;Edit&quot; feature of 60cycleCMS because the user input is unvalidated. While the unvalidated input part of this exploit is true, it is intentional and, when the CMS is installed as intended, does not expose the website to attack. Let me elaborate somewhat. The user input is unvalidated to allow a website author to post any HTML content they want. When I write this post I don&#39;t want to fight my own HTML filters. Secondly, the page in question (private/select.php?act=edit) is a private page, if the exploit author had bothered to read the readme or install the CMS, he would have noticed that install process password protects that area of the site using an .htaccess file. Therefore, only the website author (presumably trusted&#8230;.) may post unfiltered HTML and/or Javascript on the site. If you were to un-protect the private admin section of the site, then this exploit would be possible, but then of course an attacker could do anything they wanted to, whether it be deleting your posts or changing your database configuration. Presumably my users are not stupid enough to leave themselves open this way.</p>
<p>
	The second supposed vulnerability is a remote file inclusion vulnerability. Here&#39;s a <a href="http://securityreason.com/wlb_show/WLB-2009120070">link</a>. Originally posted over at exploit-db.com, this exploit claimed that you could include a remote file in the PHP powering the CMS, thus allowing you to execute arbitrary code on the webserver. The &quot;exploit&quot; centered around overwriting the $_SERVER variable so that the CMS would load the config.php file from another location besides the usual (one level above website root). This vulnerability is just plain false. PHP does not allow a remote user to override the $_SERVER variable, for obvious reasons. There&#39;s an email thread discussing this in more detail <a href="http://attrition.org/pipermail/vim/2009-December/002302.html">here</a>. The exploit has been removed from ExploitDB (I can only assume because it is incorrect), but a few sites around the web still have it up.</p>
<p>
	The point is, don&#39;t believe everything you read on the web. It would seem there&#39;s people out there trying to make us think they&#39;re l33t hackers by exposing security vulnerabilities when, in reality, they don&#39;t do their homework and are sometimes just plain wrong. If you do have any concerns about the security of 60cycleCMS, please <a href="http://60cycle.net/contact.php">contact me</a> or leave a comment, and I will be happy to discuss your concerns.</p>

    <link href="http://davidvg.com/2010/03/27/60cyclecms-2-5-1-released/"/>
    <updated>2010-03-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidvg.com/2010/03/27/60cyclecms-2-5-1-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
	I know, two posts about 60cycleCMS in one day :-). Supporting the webmaster over at <a href="http://www.aegamestudios.com/blog.php">aegamestudios</a> while he was installing 60cycleCMS motivated me to put together another release.</p>
<p>
	60cycleCMS 2.5.1, ironically, considering my previous post, does address a potential security vulnerability. While previously I was using a somewhat lame white-list filter to filter input from the URL &quot;post&quot; parameter, I&#39;ve switched to using PHP&#39;s real_escape_string() from mysqli. While I&#39;m not sure of the exact method, I suspect my previous white-list filter could have been bypassed, and an attacker could have done some damage with SQL injection. Using real_escape_string() should completely mitigate this potential vulnerability.</p>
<p>
	This release also includes a custom negative CAPTCHA (in addition to ReCAPTCHA) to protect against spammers with a bunch of human CAPTCHA breakers from some disadvantaged country. Lastly it includes CSS stylesheet listing all the custom classes used by 60cycleCMS, for easier customization (thanks to Madison at aegamestudios.com for that suggestion).</p>
<p>
	As always, you can download the latest zip from the <a href="http://60cycle.net/source/60cycleCMS.php">project page</a>, or checkout the latest code from <a href="http://svn.60cycle.net/60cycleCMS">svn</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
	A while ago I installed CentOS 5.4 in a VM running in VirtualBox. After installing the Guest Additions, and doing a few setup tasks, I noticed that the VM was almost pegging one core of my dual-core host CPU. The load would periodically drop to about 50%, but then return to 100%. Googling revealed the problem to be the CentOS kernel running at 1000 Hz. I didn&#39;t want to recompile the kernel, but providing an option to GRUB did the trick. Adding &quot;divider=10&quot; to the end of the kernel has been working beautifully. So your menu.lst entry for CentOS should read something like this:<br />
	<br />
	<code>title CentOS (2.6.18-164.6.1.el5)<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;root (hd0,0)<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.18-164.6.1.el5 ro root=.... rhgb quiet divider=10<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;initrd /initrd-2.6.18-164.6.1.el5.img</code></p>

    <link href="http://davidvg.com/2009/12/02/60cyclecms-2-5-0-released/"/>
    <updated>2009-12-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidvg.com/2009/12/02/60cyclecms-2-5-0-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
	At long last I&#39;ve found some time to work on <a href="http://60cycle.net/source/60cycleCMS.php">60cycleCMS</a>, and version 2.5.0 is the result. A major change in 2.5.0 is the addition of a new visitor comment system. I&#39;ve integrated <a href="http://recaptcha.net">RECAPTCHA</a> and <a href="http://htmlpurifier.org">HTML Purifier</a> to thwart spammers and XSS, respectively. I&#39;ve also allowed for email notifications of new comments. Of course, the comment system is both optional and configurable, meaning you can enable or disable it and its features at will.</p>
<p>
	As always, you can see the latest version in action on this very website. I&#39;ve also notified the admins at <a href="http://php.opensourcecms.com/scripts/details.php?scriptid=337">opensourceCMS</a>, and hopefully a demo of the new version will be available soon.</p>
<p>
	Download the new version from the <a href="http://60cycle.net/source/60cycleCMS.php">project page</a> or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sixtycyclecms/">SourceForge</a>.</p>

    <id>http://davidvg.com/2009/11/26/dropbox-referral-link</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
	<a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> has been around for a while, but I hadn&#39;t really been interested in it until my fiancee&#39;s laptop started making strange noises. As a result she&#39;s using my desktop to do some of her work, as well as her (possibly dying) laptop. Not to mention she&#39;s constantly emailing herself files to access them on school computers. So, a backup and sync solution seems to be in order.</p>
<p>
	Having set Dropbox up for both of us, I&#39;m really impressed so far, especially since it works seamlessly with Linux, my platform of choice. Ars Technica has a good <a href="http://arstechnica.com/software/news/2008/09/how-dropbox-ended-my-search-for-seamless-sync-on-linux.ars">review</a> of the service, and many others have jotted down their thoughts, so I&#39;m not going to go any further than saying I like it.</p>
<p>
	If you&#39;re interested in using Dropbox, use this referral link: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTMyMDkwNDc5">https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTMyMDkwNDc5</a>, and we&#39;ll both get an extra 250 MB of storage!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
	I&#39;ve been working with the Google Maps API recently for another website I&#39;m working on, and I frequently find myself creating new GMarkers from a latitude and longitude pair. So far, the best way I&#39;ve found of getting a location&#39;s exact latitude and longitude is this:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Go to <a href="http://maps.google.com">maps.google.com</a> and find the location</li>
	<li>
		Right click at your desired location on the map, and select &quot;Center map here&quot;</li>
	<li>
		In the top right hand corner of the map, click the &quot;Link&quot; link</li>
	<li>
		Copy-paste the resultant URL elsewhere. In the middle of the URL is a parameter similar to this: ll=42.963615,-85.664263, that&#39;s your latitude and longitude pair</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Enjoy!</p>

    <link href="http://davidvg.com/2009/10/04/wrt160n-dyndns-and-upgrading-firmware/"/>
    <updated>2009-10-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidvg.com/2009/10/04/wrt160n-dyndns-and-upgrading-firmware</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
	Having noticed that my WRT160N router wasn&#39;t updating my DynDNS records regularly, I checked out the <a href="http://www.linksysbycisco.com/US/en/support/WRT160N/download">latest firmware releases</a> from Linksys. Turns out v3.0.02 fixes the problem, according to the <a href="http://downloads.linksysbycisco.com/downloads/WRT160Nv3-3002_003.txt">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>
	However I ran into some trouble uploading the firmware. The upload would get to 98%, hang for a minute or so, and then the page would give me a &quot;Firmware upgrade failed&quot; message. At that point the router web interface would crash and I would have to power cycle it. Anyway after monkeying around with it a bunch of times, I got it to work. Moral of the story, if your firmware upgrade is failing, you might try any and all of these things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		If you&#39;re running Linux, try using Windows (I ended up using an XP virtual machine)</li>
	<li>
		Try IE instead of Firefox</li>
	<li>
		Use HTTP to access the router instead of HTTPS</li>
	<li>
		Curse the router repeatedly</li>
</ul>
<p>
	I&#39;m still not sure which of those steps did the trick, but my money is on the last one :-). Hope that helps someone out there.</p>

    <link href="http://davidvg.com/2009/09/17/fixing-4gb-seg-fixup-messages-from-imagemagick/"/>
    <updated>2009-09-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidvg.com/2009/09/17/fixing-4gb-seg-fixup-messages-from-imagemagick</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
	The last few days had me banging my head against the wall trying to fix a &quot;4gb seg fixup&quot; problem that was polluting logs and slowing down a web app I was working on. The project uses CentOS 5.2 running on a Xen hypervisor. It&#39;s a very common problem, and a quick Google search will turn up the same three solutions: use glibc-xen (libc6-xen for you .deb people), disable your tls libraries, and/or put &quot;hwcap 0 nosegneg&quot; in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libc6-xen.conf.</p>
<p>
	That&#39;s all well and good, but those solutions didn&#39;t work. Much frustration was had until a co-worker got a &quot;message from God&quot; via Twitter, and solved the problem. The kicker here is that we were using a manually compiled build of ImageMagick for some graphics processing. Apparently, in this case the solution is to recompile ImageMagick without OpenMP support, and voila, the problem is solved.</p>
<p>
	Thanks to the <a href="http://twitter.com/rev_null/status/1776819174">Rev. Null</a> for the solution. Anybody wondering about the source of the 4gb seg fixup problem should check out this <a href="http://book.xen.prgmr.com/mediawiki/index.php/Troubleshooting#A_constant_stream_of_.224gb_seg_fixup.22_messages">link</a>.</p>
